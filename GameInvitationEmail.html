<title>Five Crowns Game Invitation</title>
</head><body>
Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
You've been invited to join a <span style="font-weight: bold;">CURRENTLY IN PROCESS</span> game of Five Crowns!
<br/>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Using your terminal or command prompt, access the folder containing the file "fc.py".<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Launch your game player by typing: python3 fc.py.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(...or if that doesn't work, just try: python fc.py).</br>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dialog prompting you to "Paste the URL from the EMAIL INVITATION" should appear.<br/>
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2)  Here's the URL to cut and paste into the dialog's "Paste the URL from the EMAIL INVITATION" field:
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{URL}playerReady?id={ID}
<br/>
</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Next, enter your name in the "Name" field and click the Submit button.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should note a "check in" status message until all players have checked in.  When the last invited<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;player checks in, the game will automatically begin.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Refresh button every 5 or 10 seconds on the upper right of the screen to determine <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when it's your turn, at which point, you'll be prompted with a "pick from deck or discard" dialog.<br/>
<br/>
May the odds be ever in your favor,<br/>
<br/>
